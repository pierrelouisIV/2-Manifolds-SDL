# 2-manifolds projection with SDL

## Installation :
- Copy the repository
- Make sure to have SDL library
- And build the executable :
```bash
make
```

## Typical example of 2-manifolds :
### Sphere or $S^2$
1. Classical projection with longitude & latitude
2. Icosahedron to Icosphere

### Torus or $T^2$
1. TO DO

## Curve on 2-manifold
1. Trajectory on $S^2$
